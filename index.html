                            <p>● An intern management system is a software, that helps an organization intern to give their best efforts every
                                day to achieve the goals of an organization. It guides and manages intern’s efforts in right direction. It also
                                securely stores and manages personal and other work-related details of interns. That makes it easier to store
                                and access the data when there is need.<br>
                                ● I have designed an application for intern management system website with Asp.net, Web API, Angular8, Dot
                                net testing using jasmine and karma, MS test, Proper normalization, Exception handling, Log4Net, C#, SQL
                                server.</p>

                            <p> ● I had created a website for customers to book vaccination appointment which should be responsive to any
                                device like Laptop, Desktop, or mobiles. I have used Bootstrap and Angular.<br>
                                ● I had created a registration form for vaccination to customer and provide a login page so that they can see 
                                the details etc.<br>
                                ● Here I implemented UI/UX of the SPA application using HTML5, Angular, and backend with API. Net core</p>

                            <p> ● I have designed theatre booking system for action movies where you can have multiple theatres and users,
                                users can register to any theatre.<br>
                                ● User can select any theatre using dropdown and fetch all users. And users can be able to delete and update 
                                his profile. I had used OAuth to login as user</p>

                            <p> ● Developed this project that aims to implement machine learning models on email dataset along with
                                bio-inspired algorithms were implemented to optimize the performance of classifiers.<br>
                                ● Completed the system design using unified modelling language, block diagram and use case diagrams.
                                ● Implemented data set reading and inspection that can be taken as spam assassin and genetic algorithm   
                                to optimize the performance of classifiers. Implemented code based on the multinomial naive bayes that relies on bayes theorem</p>
